## Project Name: C.A.C.H.E
The name of our project is C.A.C.H.E. It stands for 'Clean Air and Care for Healthy Environment'
### Aim of Project: To mobilise people and aware them about Air Pollution.
CACHE is an open-source area targetted to solve problems of air pollution. We are creating a platform that aims to provide all of the 'Air Quality Index' statistics in one place. We have utilized sensors that send data to our Machine Learning models. The model processes it and generates predicted values. We are promoting the Saaf Hawa Aur Nagrik (S.H.A.N) campaign through our project. Our project provides people with different ways they can use to combat air pollution and climate change. We are also initiating a campaign for gathering data from users. In our country, we do not have many datasets that can give us data related to Air Quality. Hence using our project people can crowdsource and send data that can be further used for analysis and prediction. We would be able to mobilize people to fight for Air Pollution because one of the most pressing issues in the post-COVID-era is 'Air pollution'. This is our attempt to encourage people for our cause in the reduction of air pollution and make the country a better place to live.
